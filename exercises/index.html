		<h2>The Design of Code: Organizing JavaScript</h2>
		<h4> by <a href="www.google.com"> ANTHONY COLANGELO </a> &bull; <a href="http://www.alejandraaviles.com/">25 comments </a> </h4>

		<p>Well-designed code is much easier to maintain, optimize, and extend, making for more efficient developers. Three high-level, language-agnostic aspects of code design are key to achieving this nirvana: system architecture, maintainability, and reusability. All three may be attained via the module pattern, whose extensible structure lends itself to a solid system architecture and a maintainable codebase. Anthony Colangelo shows how to craft our code into well-organized components that can be reused in projects to come.</p>

		<h2>Writing Testable JavaScript</h2>
		<h4> by <a href="www.google.com"> REBECCA MURPHEY </a> &bull; <a href="www.google.com">19 comments </a> </h4>

		<p>As our JavaScript takes on more and more responsibilities, we need a reliable codebase one that is thoroughly tested. Integration tests focus on how the pieces of an application work together, but don't tell us whether individual units of functionality are behaving as expected. That's where unit testing comes in. And we'll have a hard time writing unit tests until we start writing testable JavaScript. Rebecca Murphey explains how to save time in the long run by writing cleaner application code and testing, testing, testing.</p>
